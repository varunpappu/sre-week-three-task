Identify potential solutions or products, whether free or commercial, to address the toil in the ticketing system. These solutions should aim to mitigate issues such as recurring obsolete alerts and lack of prioritization.

- One potential solution to address the toil in the ticketing system is to implement an automated alert management system. This system can consist of alerts of various priority based on the severity and relevance. This way we could reduce the number of false positive alerts that would need our attention.

- Additionally, machine learning algorithms can also help in identifying trends and patterns for a particular data set and there by help prevent recurring issues.

- There are multiple commerical tools on the market (ELK, Splunk, Datadog etc) that offers advanced features such as automated ticket routing, SLA management, and customizable workflows. This could streamline entire ticketing process and ensure that tickets are handled efficiently and in a prioritized manner.

- Lastly, implementing a knowledge base or a self-service portal (Stackoverflow, backstage, Notion etc) can empower users to find solutions to common issues on their own, reducing the number of tickets raised thereby freeing up resources to focus on more critical tasks.

- It is important to note that one needs to evaluate these solutions based on the requirements and constraints of the organization in order to choose the correct fit.
